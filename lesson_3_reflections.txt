When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If you want to share your code to other collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is to prevent unintended changes to your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branch makes a new path in your local repository. Clone allows you to make a copy of a repository to your local driver, whether from the same local drive or from GitHub. Fork allows you to make a copy of a GitHub repository to your own GitHub account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can review the changes made to remote even while offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	If there is no Git or GitHub, collaboration will be done by copy-pasting files back and forth to a central server. It will be harder since there is no way to track and review changes.
