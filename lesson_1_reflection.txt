How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It will display which lines were changed between the two files. The bug could be among these changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could allow me to go back to any version of the file and in effect, discard new features or restore old features easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can associate meaningful labels to each commit and you can control when to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in codes, files are normally logically related. Google docs do not treat the files as codes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to display version history with their labels and git diff to see which lines were changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It allows me to revert back to previous working version at any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my programming projects.
