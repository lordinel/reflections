How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area allows you to specify which files to track for the commit. It allows you to select which files to include in the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	It allows me to review the files to be added in the commit before making the actual commit.
